This assessment is was to help me understand the concept of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines since its an essential aspect of modern software development. This CI/CD pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software,which allows me as a developer to deliver high-quality code quickly and consistently to production environments. 
This project basically involves the first three stages which are Source control, Unit testing and Build automation.

First, I created a simple math calculator in Python, my favorite programming language.
I then created a branch, added several features to the calculator, and pushed the codes to my Github repository.
I used pytest to run a unit test on the calculator to ensure that it functions flawlessly.
Lastly, I developed a script called calculator.yml that automates the testing, cleaning, and compilation of my project.
